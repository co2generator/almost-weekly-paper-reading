### Background

In this project, we intend to make a collection of optimization related classical papers in the ***Operations Research/Operations Management*** community. 

The project is organized as following two parts, ``deterministic optimization`` and ``stochastic optimization``. In the ``determinsitic optimization``, there are 4 directions: ``branch-and-cut``, ``lagrangian relaxation``, ``branch-and-price`` and ``benders decomposition``. In the stochastic optimization, there 3 directions: ``robust optimization``, ``stochastic optimization`` and ``distributionally robust optimization``.

For each direction, there will be a paper list written in Markdown. In which, the paper list and famous scholars are included. And for every collected paper, there will be a paper reading note attached, which is written in Tex. In every note, the problem setting, motivation, solution approach and so on will be reported.
